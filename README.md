# Stanford-Algorithms-Specialization
Problem Set and Programming Assignment Solutions in C++ to Stanford University's Algorithms Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).

## Introduction
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth. This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience. The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details. After completing this specialization, you will have a greater mastery of algorithms than almost anyone without a graduate degree in the subject.

This repository contains the problem set and programming assignment solutions in C++ to the specialization. On Coursera, the specialization consists of four courses.
